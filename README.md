# SEWING-ROBOT
A sewing robotic effector to explore a dry and flexible connection of rigid materials
Explore a dry and flexible connection of rigid materials. A joint that allows to connect large parts by moving the robotic arm and not the material.
The hypothesis is to work on a joint that allows to connect large parts by moving the robotic arm and not the material. The goal to achieve is to explore a new field of connections and joints with traditional systems.
